## Walk Through
 - A simple front page (which I'll be improving later)
 - Login and Register page linked to front page
 - On clicking the login button on login page you will be directed to user page
 - A two Step Registration
 - On clicking the register button you would be directed to admin page
 - User Page
   - Dashboard : User Details + Events he/she is registered in
   - Events: See the events they have registered in + Last button will direct them to a page where they can see all the live 
   events(yet to create this page)
   - Terms and Conditions: May be upgdated by tomorrow
  - Admin Page:
   - Dashboard : User Details
   - Events: Events they have created 
   - Forms: Here the user can create the google form  for registration of the events they have created. Working on it
   
## Issues
 - Was not able to trigger `create new event` button in events section. I have wriiten the codes in event.js. Review once
 - Any suggestion on form section??
